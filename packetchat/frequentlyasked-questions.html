                        <summary>How long will it take for my conference badge to be finished?  </summary>
                        <p>Expect no less than 6 months, and up to a year, for your conference badge to be completed.  We put lots of effort into making sure your badge will function just the way you want it, and this takes time!  </p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="question-box">
                        <summary>Are your badges all open source?  </summary>
                        <p>Yes!  We value sharing our knowledge with the community, so we publish the diagrams, schematics, and code for our badges to our <a href="https://github.com/packetchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> after the conference (we don't want to give any spoilers beforehand!)</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="question-box">
                        <summary>Are the badges useful after the conference is over?  </summary>
                        <p>Absolutely!  Right before the conference ends, we push new, stand-alone firmware to all the badges.  This allows them to be used for a variety of different purposes after the conference.  </p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="question-box">
                        <summary>How hackable are the badges?  What are the typical connectors you use to allow badge hacking?  </summary>
                        <p>Our badges are very hackable!  We utilize at least 2 SAO connectors on each badge.  These provide standardized I2C pins, 2 GPIO pins, a 3.3 volt pin, and a ground pin.  </p>
                        <p>We generally base our badges on MicroPython, and use ESP32 micro controllers.  </p>

                    <details class="question-box">
                        <summary>What if my badge stops working?  How do I reset it?  </summary>
                        <p>If your badge isn't working correctly, simply powering off the badge and powering it back on (or using the reset button) should fix it.  If you still have issues, come find us at the conference, and we'll help you troubleshoot it!  </p>

                        <summary>What else should I know about PacketChat's badges before I purchase from you?  </summary>
                        <p>Each badge is a unique, custom work of art.  Above all else, we make badges because it's our art medium.  If you have an idea for a badge, let's talk about it (We get really excited about badge ideas)!  </p>
