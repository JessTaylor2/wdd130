        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Homepage</h3>
      <p>A few of our most notable projects include conference badges for … (list a couple of conferences they’ve built badges for here)</p>

      <p>The … badge (name of badge, and what conference it was built for) was built with …, and features … (talk about main details and features of what the badge was made of and what it could do).  The highlight of this badge was … (anything specially requested, or the most prominent or interesting or most used feature of the badge).  (Repeat this section, worded in various ways, for each badge.  This will be shown in a dedicated section, with photos of each finished badge above the text.)</p>

      <p>(Maybe talk a little about the process of constructing a new badge, including what value points such as part quality, construction and soldering quality, and more, are included in the value of the badge.  Talk about benefits of PacketChat making custom badges for these conferences.  What will the customer get out of this?  Why should they buy PacketChat’s products over others, or over making the badges themselves?)</p>

      <p>PacketChat also focuses on creating emergency communications radio networks, and has distributed and tested these radio networks with the help of local community members.  One such test was a large-scale mountain hike and campout, held for … youth (approximate number of youth attending Trek) between the ages of 13 and 18 in July 2025.  </p>
        
      <p>PacketChat team members worked tirelessly to create each radio by hand, and then placed … radios (number of radios) onto mountaintops and treetops, several days (change this to more accurate number, if possible) prior to the hike.  </p>
        
      <p>Each “handcart,” a wooden cart assigned to a group of youth and which carried each youth’s camping equipment, also received a radio.  These radios were carefully hidden inside the handcart to avoid notice, and allowed the youth leaders to communicate with each other through their cell phones, track where each handcart group was, and call for medical help when necessary - all without requiring cell service!  </p>
        
      <p>(Insert something about how PacketChat radios are now being offered to other local community members to aid in their own mountain hikes and campouts.  Also include how these radios can be applicable to other emergency situations, as well.  Why should our customers care about these radios?  What benefits will they receive from buying one?)</p>
        
      <p>(Show images of the radios, including several photos of the radios in use, if possible.  This may require written permission from those in the photo, however, so tread carefully here.)</p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>
        General Delivery Timeline And Process: (Talk a little bit about the process the team goes through in order to start working on a new order, particularly for the badges, since that’s currently their primary market.  It probably goes something like this: Receive the order, draw up some ideas, settle with the client on the plans, then assign each team member a portion of the work, source the parts, start building a prototype, send prototypes to team members for testing and validation, then refine and prototype again as needed, then finalize everything and send to client for approval.  Talk about the approximate length of time it takes to go through this process, and why that’s a marker of high quality.  It probably takes at least a few months or more to go through the entire process)

      <h3>Homepage</h3>
      <p>         
        The homepage is going to be a little bit like a portfolio of their work.  I decided not to include the team photos for this assignment, but I may add it in future if my client wants me to.

      <h3>Questions</h3>

        This is going to have a dropdown menu of questions and answers for common questions.

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>         
        I opted not to do a contact form, because it would require code far beyond my current skill level.  For now, I am only going to list some basic contact information (as much as my client is willing to share, as they are still a small company).
