                <h1>PacketChat</h1>
                <p>PacketChat is a small electronics business, located in Northern California, which creates cyber conference badges and emergency radios.  Our team designed and produced 400 conference badges for HushCon West in December of 2023, and we have several more badge designs in the works.  If you are interested in working with us to create a custom cyber conference badge, please contact us!  </p>
                <p>Our company is an entirely open source company: we love sharing what we do with the community!  As such, we release all our designs, as well as the software and schematics of our conference badges, once the conference is over.  </p>

                    <h3>The Monkey Badge</h3>
                    <p>The Monkey badge was created by PacketChat for the HushCon West conference in December of 2023.  This was the first cyber conference badge to have an FM radio receiver inside, and to use over-the-air downloading firmware at various points in the conference.  The badge was modeled after the three monkeys See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Speak No Evil: represented by a monkey wearing sunglasses, a monkey wearing headphones, and a monkey wearing a mask, respectively.  </p>
                    <p>The highlight of this badge was the variety of puzzles and challenges that could be completed with it during the conference.  To gather clues for one of the challenges, conference attendees could attach earphones to the badge and listen for the clues hidden in a specifically tuned radio broadcast.  After each challenge or puzzle was completed, the badge would download new firmware and begin another challenge.  PacketChat has several other badges in the works, some of which take some inspiration from the Monkey badge.  </p>

                    <h3>PacketChat Mesh (also known as PacketChat Trek)</h3>
                    <p>PacketChat also focuses on creating emergency communications radio networks, and has distributed and tested these radio networks with the help of local community members. One such test was a large-scale mountain hike and campout, held for 175 youth between the ages of 13 and 18 in July 2025.  </p>
                    <p>22 prototype radios were distributed amongst the trail boss, the campout leader, the medical staff, the nurse's station, the logistics and communications crews, and to the security team.  Each “handcart,” a wooden cart assigned to a group of youth and which carried each youth’s camping equipment, also received a radio.  These radios were carefully hidden inside the handcart to avoid notice, and allowed the youth leaders to communicate with each other through their cell phones, track where each handcart group was, and call for medical help when necessary - all without requiring cell service!  </p>
