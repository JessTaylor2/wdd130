                <h1>PacketChat</h1>
                <p>PacketChat is a small electronics business, located in Northern California, which creates cyber conference badges and emergency radios.  Our team designed and produced 400 conference badges for HushCon West in December of 2023, and we have several more badge designs in the works.  If you are interested in working with us to create a custom cyber conference badge, please contact us!  </p>
                <p>Our company is an entirely open source company: we love sharing what we do with the community!  As such, we release all our designs, as well as the software and schematics of our conference badges, once the conference is over.  </p>

                    <p>Created for the HushCon West conference in December 2023, the Monkey badge was the first cyber conference badge to have an FM radio receiver inside, and to use over-the-air firmware updates.  </p>
